inittab_fix
===========

This isn't really an app, it just overwrites the broken /etc/inittab
from PetaLinux with a working one.

PetaLinux's inittab assumes a console on ttyPS0, and if you change the
serial port to ttyPS1, it doesn't propagate that change everywhere
needed (really, it barely propagates it anywhere).

So the simple fix here is just to create an "app" which overwrites
the inittab in the filesystem.
