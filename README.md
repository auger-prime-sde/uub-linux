# uub-linux
PetaLinux distribution for UUB

Note: I haven't tested importing this yet. I have no idea if it'll work. But you can try!

u-boot-uub is not included here: so after you clone this repository, create a link inside components/u-boot to the u-boot-uub repository.

Then petalinux-build should work. Maybe.
